## Theme Overview

The compiled CSS gets included when Zazu is launched. Be sure to include a
`zazu.json` file in the root of your project with the following information:

~~~ javascript
{
  "name": "Light Theme",
  "stylesheet": "dist/main.css"
}
~~~~

### Fields

* `stylesheet` *string*: A relative path to the CSS to be used when displaying
  the Zazu window.

## Previewing your theme

A [theme
playbook](https://tinytacoteam.github.io/zazu-theme-playbook) exists so you can
preview your Zazu theme with a few of the basic cases.

Take a look at some of the other themes on the [packages](/themes/) page for
some inspiration.

## Using your theme

Just add your relative path to your GitHub repo inside of your [personal
configuration](/documentation/configuration/#theme).

## Naming your theme

It is a convention that themes are named with the prefix `zazu-`. For example if you are
creating a steam punk theme you could name it `zazu-steam-punk`.
